### Youtube Channel

Remember to upload the trailer (and all future Heist videos) to the Placeholder Software youtube account (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXN3n6Etm7wgwkSYiuP6jA/feed).

Should start popualting this with some interesting content. Say a weekly/monthly "changelog" video showing off what's been changed/added. A changelog video sounds boring but wolfire does it for overgrowth and gets **~100k views** for each weekly changelog (I guess because they're generally very short and to the point)!

## Trailer

This is the main trailer that auto-plays when you open placeholder-software.co.uk, so the purpose here is to show off a few cool things and then dive into a demo of some of the things the game can do explained (voice over) by me.

### Important things to communicate
 - This Is All Alpha!
 - Procedural generation
 - Multiplayer
 - Deathmatch gameplay
 - Heist gameplay
 - Plugins - i.e. it's not just about heists or deathmatches
 
### Script

1. Start with a run through the tutorial bank, with a voice over explaining what's going on
 - Tutorial bank
 - Doors, alarms, NPCs(?)
2. Mention how even the tutorial bank is procedurally generated
3. Pick up another player to help with the tutorial bank heist
 - Ideally invite player to join a game in progress
4. Close up by flicking through a few other gamemodes, 5 second clips of DM, CTF, TDM, KoTH, Construction mode etc
 - This needs those modes implemented in at least a basic form
